    <ul>
      <li>Device information (model, OS version).</li>
      <li>Usage data (app open times, feature usage, session length).</li>
      <li>Crash logs and diagnostic data to improve app stability.</li>
      <li>IP address and approximate location derived from your IP for analytics and security.</li>
      <li>With your permission, precise device location (GPS) if you enable location-based features—this is optional and controlled by your device settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide, operate, and maintain the app and its features.</li>
      <li>Save and display your daily weather logs and associated media.</li>

      <li>Analyze usage patterns to improve the app and fix issues.</li>
      <li>Protect against fraud, abuse, and security threats.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Legal Bases for Processing (Where Applicable)</h2>
    <p>Where required by law (for example, in the European Economic Area), we rely on one or more of the following legal bases to process personal data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Processing necessary to perform the contract with you (providing the app).</li>
      <li>Your consent for optional features, such as precise location or marketing communications.</li>
      <li>Our legitimate interests to operate and improve the app, provided those interests do not override your rights.</li>
      <li>Compliance with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> trusted third-party vendors who perform services on our behalf (hosting, analytics, email delivery). We require these providers to protect your data.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal reasons:</strong> when required by law, to respond to legal process, or to protect our rights or safety.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets. If such a transfer occurs, we will notify affected users where required by law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Astemix may use third-party services (such as cloud hosting, analytics, and crash reporting). These services may collect and process technical and usage data. Their use is governed by their own privacy policies; we encourage you to review them. We limit the data shared to what is necessary for those services to operate.</p>

    <h2>6. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>We and our service providers use cookies, local storage, and similar technologies to operate and improve the app, remember preferences, and collect analytics. On mobile devices, similar mechanisms may be used. You can control certain tracking features through your device and app settings.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to provide the services and fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. If you delete your account, we will delete or anonymize your data within a reasonable timeframe, except for data we are required to retain for legal or legitimate business reasons.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding your personal information, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access: request a copy of the data we hold about you.</li>
      <li>Correction: request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
      <li>Deletion: request deletion of your personal data (subject to legal exceptions).</li>
      <li>Portability: request a machine-readable copy of certain data.</li>
      <li>Opt-out: opt out of promotional emails or certain tracking where applicable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, please contact us using the information below. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling certain requests.</p>

    <p>Astemix is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a child under the applicable age, please contact us and we will delete the information as required by law.</p>

    <h2>10. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your country of residence. We take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards for international transfers, such as contractual protections where required.</p>

    <h2>11. Security</h2>
    <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the information we collect. While we take reasonable steps to protect your information, no security measure is perfect, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
